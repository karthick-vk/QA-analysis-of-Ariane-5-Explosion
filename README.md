Quality Assurance of Requirement Analysis Phase in the Ariane 5

1. In this project, We have analyzed the explosion of the Ariane-5 rocket and proposed a model to assure the quality of the requirement analysis phase.
2. Through this analysis, we have concluded that failure to capture requirement changes due to inefficient verification of requirement documents, lack of collaboration between various stakeholders while preparing and analyzing requirement documents had contributed to the failure of Ariane-5.
